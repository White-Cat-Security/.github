## About Us

White Cat Security is a fictional company created as part of a cybersecurity challenge by Trustly. Our team is comprised of students from the Faculdade de Informática e Administração Paulista (FIAP), specializing in Cyber Defense. We aim to develop robust security solutions for monitoring workstations in a corporate environment.

## Our Solution

Our project is focused on creating an agent installed on workstations and an accessible web panel for security department personnel. The main features include:

- **User Account Monitoring:** Tracks the creation and use of user accounts.
- **Application Installation Monitoring:** Observes the installation of new applications and alterations to sensitive files.
- **Privilege Escalation Detection:** Detects unauthorized attempts to escalate user privileges.
- **Proactive IP Blocking:** Implements firewall rules to block IPs based on their reputation via AbuseIPdb.
- **File Integrity Checking:** Utilizes VirusTotal to check the hashes of downloaded files, determining whether to block or allow them.

## Technologies Used

- **Open Source Tools:** Leveraging open-source technologies to develop and manage our security solutions.
- **Cloud Environment:** Utilizing a cloud platform for centralized data integration and real-time management.

## Web Panel Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Provides a real-time overview of security events and threats.
- **Data Analysis Integration:** Ensures efficient data collection, analysis, and presentation, facilitating quick and informed decision-making.
